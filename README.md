================

A custom Wordpress theme for my portfolio website, nickwoll{dot}com. 

This was originally developed in 2013 for a job hunt and left unfinished when I began work at EA Tiburon in Orlando, FL. It was meant to be a fully functioning Wordpress theme applied to a live site hosted on an EC2 instance, but the site was ultimately hosted as a static web page using Amazon S3 for cost purposes.
