================

The assets for my personal website, nickwoll{dot}com, circa 2021. 

This site was prototyped in Figma and is written in pure HTML5 and CSS3, with SVG icons provided by Pixel perfect (https://www.flaticon.com/authors/pixel-perfect) at Flaticon and devicon.dev (https://devicon.dev/). The site is hosted on S3 cloud storage provided by Amazon Web Services (http://aws.amazon.com/).

The legacy version of this site was originally developed in 2013 for a job hunt and left unfinished when I began work at Electronic Arts. It was meant to be a fully functioning Wordpress theme applied to a live site hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, but the site was ultimately hosted as a static web page using S3 cloud storage for cost purposes.
